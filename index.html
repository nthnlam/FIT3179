     <p>Prior to the 2019 Federal Election, Parliament was structured into 150 seats, with the Liberal/National Coaltion (LNC) sharing 76 seats, The Australian Labour Party (ALP) holding 69 and the crossbench sharing 5 seats.</p>
     <p class="mb-4">Additionally, due to electorate redistribution and boundary restructuring in 2018, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory gained a seat while South Australia lost a seat meaning the total amount of seats increased to 151.
     In addition, the Victorian Liberal seats of Corangamite and Dunkley became notionally Labor seats.</p>
     <p class="mb-4">Both Liberal and National Parties held electorates outside of Victoria held strong percentages exceeding 60% of the total vote and 70% in Farrer, NSW and Curtin, WA, whereas Labour stronghelds tended towards urbanised regions in Victoria, NSW and Tasmania.</p>

     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary"><q>Here and now</q></h2>
     <p>The 2019 election brought about several upsets across the board. Despite investing $70 million in the election and contesting every electorate, the United Australia Party did not win any seats in Parliament.
     In addition, Wentworth, NSW while previously being held by Labour by a 62% margin, shifted to independet Zali Steggal in an unforeseen upset.
     The notionally held seats of Corangamite and Dunkley were officially won by the ALP, while the Tasmanian seats of Bass and Braddon unexpectedly shifted to Liberal essentially changing the course of the election.</p>
     <p class="mb-4">LNC voters became increasingly loyal to their respective parties espescially in Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, while Labour voters had a generally lower percentage of total votes across the board.
     Victoria and Queensland recorded the highest single party percentages with over 70% favouring the LNC in Maranoa, Groom and Nichols, while Scullin and Melbourne gained a similar percentage with Labour and The Greens respectively.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">State voting preferences tended towards national voting preferences with a few notable exceptions. Larger, agriculture focused states including Western Australia and Queensland tend to vote towards Liberal/National
        and have strong representation by boutique parties like One Nation.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Smaller states and areas of strong population density lean towards voting Labour and Greens. Labour voters in the previous election however swung away from the party (-1.39 swing) to the Coaltion (+1.17) and the Greens (+0.17).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Independents also played a large role in Tasmania, Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, claiming 3 seats overall.</p>

       <p class="mb-4">Approximately 15 million Australians voted with 14.3 million votes valid and counted.
         The 5 largest state parties consisting of the ALP, LNP, and LP in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland generated more than 6.9 million votes and won 95 of the 151 seats available.
         </p>
       <p class="mb-4">On average, in order to obtain 1 seat, a state party would need on average 94,613 votes.
         This means that parties including The Greens (1.5 million votes) and the United Australia Party (488,817 votes) appear to be underrepresented in terms of seats taken (1 and 0 respectively),
         while parties like The Nationals are overrepresented with 10 seats from 642,233 total votes.</p>

     <p class="mb-4">Queensland and Tasmania unexpectedly won seats for the LNC while NSW incurred a net loss for the ALP, losing one seat to the independent, Zali Steggal.
     Victory for the crossbench has led to victory for the LNC.</p>
